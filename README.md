## About The App

Calendar app is an app that fetches a number of agenda items from the o9Solutions api and filters agenda items by day

## Technologies

I used React, NextJs, Recoil, Tailwind and Framer Motion

## Setup

- download or clone the repository.
- run `npm install` or `yarn add` to install all dependencies.
- run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to start the app.
- In your prefered browser, go to 'localhost:3000'.

## Approach

I adapted Next.js best practices, such as SSR where beneficial, File-Based Routing, Alias importing, and Hot Module Replacement. I leveraged Tailwind's benefits of Reduced CSS Bloat and Ease of Responsiveness, and explored the use of the new Recoil state management solution. Additionally, I incorporated a touch of Framer Motion for simple animations to enhance the UI.
